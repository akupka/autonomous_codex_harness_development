- Read app_spec.txt and generated feature_list.json with 200 tests.
- Created initial project structure under backend/, frontend/, infra/.
- Added minimal FastAPI skeleton and requirements in backend/.
- Added init.sh for environment setup and startup guidance.
- Rewrote README.md for project overview and setup.

Next steps:
- Confirm how to handle existing modified files in the repo before committing.
- Initialize frontend scaffolding (Vite/React) and backend API skeleton beyond /health.
- Add Makefile and docker-compose for Postgres/MinIO if desired.
